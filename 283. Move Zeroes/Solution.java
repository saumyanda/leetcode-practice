We use slow and fast pointers. The fast one moves one element at a time.

If the current element is 0, do nothing.
If the current element is non-0, swap its element with the slow pointerâ€™s element and move the slow pointer.
The slow pointer always points to the next 0 if there is one.

The order of non-0 elements is preserved because the early one always gets swapped to the early 0s.
